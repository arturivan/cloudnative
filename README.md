## Branching Strategy

- **main:** This branch contains the simulation-ready configuration for the Spark operator and related MLOps components. Changes to this branch trigger the MLOps deployment pipeline.
- **dev:** This branch contains the code and configuration for the web application. Changes to this branch trigger the web application deployment pipeline.

## Infrastructure as code repo:

I built a secure CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments for Apache Spark jobs using the Kubeflow Spark Operator on Kubernetes (RKE2). This project focuses on secure ML pipelines, scalable data transformations, and cloud-native orchestration.

Tech Stack & Tools:

- Kubernetes (RKE2) – Cluster orchestration
- Kubeflow Spark Operator – Managing Spark workloads on Kubernetes
- Apache Spark – Distributed data transformations
- GitHub Actions – CI/CD for automated Spark job deployment
- Tailscale – Secure cluster access
- Azure Entra ID – Authentication and IAM
- Grafana Cloud and Lens – Monitoring

Key Highlights:

- Created a hardened Ubuntu Minimal VM in VMware Workstation Pro and set up an RKE2 Kubernetes cluster
- Automated Spark job deployments using the Kubeflow Spark Operator
- Integrated GitHub Actions for secure and efficient CI/CD workflows
- Used Azure Container Registry for managing and securing container images
- Stored transformed data in Azure Storage for scalability and accessibility
- Configured Azure Files for backup of the Kubernetes cluster
- Used Tailscale for secure remote access to the cluster
- Implemented IAM integration and security best practices with Grafana Cloud and Azure Entra ID
- Designed for scalability, allowing efficient Spark job execution on Kubernetes
