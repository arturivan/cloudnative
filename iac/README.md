# Overview

This folder contains Bicep and Terraform projects used to deploy resources to my Azure account. The Bicep projects create App Services, Storage accounts, and VNet peering. I automated the deployment using GitHub Actions, with a separate repository still being updated. The Terraform project provisions a virtual network, subnets, a resource group, two VMs, an Azure public IP, and an Azure Application Gateway.

The new and separate repository can be found here: https://github.com/arturivan/cloudinfra
